          A credit card is a financial instrument that has a pre-loaded balance
          that the cardholder can use to make transactions and pay for them
          later. The card issuer will let you pay off the balance fully,
          interest-free, for up to 50 days from the date of payment. To avoid
          any fines, the cardholder can pay the minimum amount due (which can be
          anywhere between 5% to 10% on the total amount owed). The balance,
          however, will be carried forward to the next month, and interest set
          by the credit card company will be levied.

        <h3>Why Get A Credit Card?</h3>

          Let's start from the beginning: Why should you get your first credit
          card, let alone a bunch of credit cards? Credit cards sometimes get a
          bad rap, but they are a tool you can use to build credit, earn cash
          back, earn travel rewards, or get access to other really cool perks.
          The key is using credit cards responsibly.

          A credit card allows delayed payment for purchases, essentially
          borrowing from the issuer until the month's end. Know that credit card
          eligibility depends on a stable income and a good credit score, and it
          can also be secured against a fixed deposit. Your credit limit, 3 to 5
          times your monthly salary, varies by bank. While popular banks provide
          the card, payment gateways like Visa, MasterCard, and RuPay handle
          transactions, leaving terms like minimum due, interest, and rewards to
          the issuer's discretion.
